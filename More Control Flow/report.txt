4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Generating the Waltz)
      Approach: Created a 2d list for both the minuet and the trio.
      Used stdrandom.uniformInt for the generating the random dice throw.


      Issues and resolution: I did not use stdarray for this problem.
      I had a problem with the data file .wav it keeps telling that I have a file of unknown type.
      I tried to solve the problem but couldn't figure it out.

   Problem 2 (Playing the Waltz)
      Approach: set x as empty list. Used the function stdio.readAllInt for standard input.
      Used sys.exit for messages errors. Used stdaudio.playFile(file) for playing the sounds.

      Issues and resolution: I had the same problem with the unknown files from the data type.
      When I enter my standard input of 32 integers, it says this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\marcd\workspace\project3\playwaltz.py", line 30, in <module>
    stdaudio.playFile(File)
  File "C:\Users\marcd\lib\stdlib-python\stdaudio.py", line 74, in playFile
    a = read(f)
  File "C:\Users\marcd\lib\stdlib-python\stdaudio.py", line 116, in read
    temp.append(float(samples[i]) / float(0x7fff))
   TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars

   I tried to figure it out but no luck.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It would be great if you can tell me where my problem was or give me some feedback for my errors.
   This project was a little more difficult than the others, but I still managed to finish it.
